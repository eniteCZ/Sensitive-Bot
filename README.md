# Sensitive-Bot
This is the repository for the code used in my bachelor's thesis "Introducing Sentiment to Sequence to Sequence Chatbot models". It explores the possibility of combining TextBlob sentiment analysis tools with a Sequence to Sequence RNN chatbot trained on Reddit comment data in order to produce a chatbot which reacts to user sentiment.

Many thanks to my thesis supervisor: Dr. Sabrina Kirrane
